# Anonymous Voting System

## Project Title
Anonymous Voting System

## Project Description
This smart contract implements an anonymous voting system on the Aptos blockchain. The contract allows users to cast votes without revealing their identity while ensuring transparency and security. The system records votes in a decentralized manner, preventing any tampering or manipulation.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a secure, transparent, and anonymous digital voting system that eliminates fraud, enhances voter trust, and ensures fair elections using blockchain technology.

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Anonymity**: Implement zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) or ring signatures to further anonymize voters.
- **Decentralized Identity Verification**: Integrate a decentralized identity verification system to ensure eligibility.
- **Multi-phase Elections**: Support for multi-round elections, including primaries and runoffs.
- **Real-time Vote Counting**: Implement real-time tallying without compromising voter anonymity.
- **User-friendly Interfaces**: Develop a front-end application to make voting accessible to non-technical users.

## Key Features
- **Anonymous Voting**: Ensures that voters' identities remain hidden while their votes are counted.
- **Tamper-proof**: Built on blockchain to prevent vote manipulation.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Votes are recorded on the blockchain, reducing the risk of data corruption.
- **Simple & Efficient**: Minimalistic design for fast and reliable voting.
- **Candidate Selection**: Supports multiple candidates in an election process.
